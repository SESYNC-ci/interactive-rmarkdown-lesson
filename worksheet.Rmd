# Smart and Interactive Documents

Lesson 10 with *Kelly Hondula*

## How Smart?

The reproducible pipeline under construction begins with open data, uses scripts
to perform analyses and create visualizations, and ideally ends in a published
write-up.

[rmarkdown][1] merges code and documentation, allowing you to create automatic
reports that include the results of computations and visualizations created
on-the-fly.

## How Interactive?

Rather than rendering to a static document, RStudio lets you easily inject
[shiny][2] input and output widgets to documents constructed with RMarkdown.
These widgets can accept user input through forms, menus, and sliders, and cause
corresponding tables, plots, and other graphical output to dynamically update.

Interactive documents require connection to a live R process, which any user
running RStudio can provide, but so can hosting services like
http://www.shinyapps.io/.

## Lesson Objectives

1. Start with "dumb" documents and the basics of Markdown.
1. Envision an efficient, one-click pipeline with RMarkdown.
1. Create an interactive document with Shiny.

## Markdown

Markdown exists outside of the R environment. Like R, it is both a language and
an interpreter.

1. It is a **language** with special characters and a syntax that convey
formatting instructions inside text files.

1. The accompanying **interpreter** reads text files and outputs one of several
types of formatted documents (e.g Word, PDF, and HTML).

## RMarkdown

The [rmarkdown][1] package bundles the formatting ability of Markdown
with the ability to send embedded code to an R interpreter and capture the
result.

## Seeing is Believing

The handout for this lesson _is_ this lesson. The file `worksheet-9.Rmd` is
the RMarkdown source for this document (with a few ommissions for you to
fill in). Open it and find this line of code:

```{r}
data.frame(counts = c(4, 5, 6))
```

<div class="notes">
The output *is not in the source*---it was "knit" into the rendered
output. Press the "Knit" button in RStudio to generate the single-page view of
this lesson. As we proceed, fill in the `...` areas of your worksheet, and press
the "Knit" button to verify the output.
</div>

## Markdown Syntax

Before getting to the good stuff, a quick introduction to "dumb" Markdown
formatting.

## Preformatted Text

Text fenced by \`\`\` is left untouched by the Markdown interpreter, usually
for the purpose of displaying code.

```
The *emphasis* in this text does not become
italicized, as it would outside the "code fence".
```

<div class="notes">
That's three backtick characters, found next to the "1" on QWERTY keyboards,
above and below the text.
</div>

## Bulleted Lists (preformatted)

Sequential lines beginning with `-` are grouped into a bulleted list. The
following text shows the syntax (because the special characters are ignored).

```
- SQL
- Python
- R
```

## Bulleted Lists

This time, without the code fence, the output contains a list.

- SQL
...

## Numbered Lists (preformatted)

Sequential lines beginning with `1.` are grouped into a numbered list.
Conveniently, you don't have to increment the numbers.

```
1. SQL
1. Python
1. R
```

## Numbered Lists

This time, without the code fence, the output contains a list.

1. SQL
...

## Tables (preformatted)

Separate text with pipes (`|`) to indicate columns of a table and
hyphens (`-`) to mark the beginning of a table or to separate the header row.

```
id | treatment
---|----------
1  | control
2  | exclosure
```

## Tables

This time, without the code fence, the output contains a table.

id | treatment
---|----------
1  | control
...

## Configuration

Text at the top of a Markdown file and fenced by `---` stores configuration.
Variables set here can, for example, change the type of document produced.

```
---
output: html_document
---
```

Change the output variable to `ioslides_presentation` and knit again to generate
output formatted as a slideshow.

## Headers

Default formatting for an `html_document` differs in some cases from an `ioslides_presentation`. The use of `#` to indicate a hierarchy of heading sizes serves an additional purpose in a slideshow.

```
# The Biggest Heading
## The Second Biggest Heading
### The Third Biggest Heading
```

... The Biggest Heading
... The Second Biggest Heading
... The Third Biggest Heading

## R + Markdown (preformatted)

The [rmarkdown][1] package evaluates the R expressions within a code fence and
inserts the result into the output document. To send these "code chunks" to the
R interpreter, append `{r}` to the upper fence.

```
```{r}
seq(1, 10)
```
```

<div class="notes">
In the RMarkdown file, you can see a non-ascii character in the preformatted
chunk above. That is [U+2008](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+200B), the
"ZERO WIDTH SPACE" character. It is necessary to prevent the inner code
chunk from being processed by [rmarkdown][1] and works by breaking the
code fence.
</div>

## R + Markdown

This time, without the _outer_ code fence, the code is evaluated and its
output injected into the document.

```...
seq(1, 10)
```

## Chunk Options (preformatted)

Each code chunk runs under options specified globally or within the `{r ...}`
expression. The option `echo = FALSE` would cause the output to render without
the input. The option `eval = FALSE`, would prevent evaluation and output
rendering.

```
```{r echo = FALSE}
seq(1, 10)
```
```

## Chunk Options

This time, without the code fence, the output is rendered without the code.

```...
seq(1, 10)
```

## Chunk Labels (preformatted)

The first entry after `{r` will be interpretted as a chunk label if it is not
setting an option. Chunk options are specified after the optional label and
separated by commas.

```
```{r do_not_run, eval = FALSE}
seq(1, 10)
```
```

## Chunk Labels

This time, without the code fence, the code is echoed but not evaluated. The
label does not show up in the document---we have other uses for the label.

```{r do_not_run, eval = FALSE}
seq(1, 10)
```

## Reproducible Pipeline

A pipeline might rely on several scripts that separately aquire data, tidy it,
fit or run models, and validate results. Embedding calls to those external
scripts is one way to create a one-click pipeline.

## Sourced Pipeline (preformatted)

The `worksheet-9.R` file is an R script that produces a `rodents` data
frame, which "sourcing" makes available to subsequent code chunks.

```
```{r load_data, echo = FALSE}
source('worksheet-9.R')
```
```

<div class="notes">
If your entire pipeline can be scripted in R, you *could* embed the entire
analysis in code chunks within your write-up. A better practice is to
"modularize" your analysis with isolated scripts, and let your
[rmarkdown][1] document execute the pipeline.
</div>

## Sourced Pipeline

This time, without the code fence, the data frame is loaded into the R
environment and available to subsequent code chunks.

```{... load_data, echo = FALSE}
source(...)
```

```{... base_plot, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
plt <- ggplot(..., aes(x = species_id, y = count))
```

```{... out.width = '80%'}
plt + geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

## Non-sourced pipelines (preformatted)

The code interpreter is not limited to R. Several interpreters, including
`python` and `sql`, can be used for code written directly into a code chunk.
Access to your OS shell, for example the Linux "bash" shell, provides a way to
run any scripted pipeline steps.

```
```{bash}
python -c "print('Hello, world!')"
```
```

## Non-sourced pipelines

This time, without the code fence, the output of the shell command is captured
and rendered in the document.

```{...}
python -c "print('Hello, world!')"
```

<div class="notes">
An important distinction between sourced and non-sourced pipelines is the
inabillity of interpreters other than R to return R objects. By using `source`,
an R script is run in the current R session, which provides an easy way to pass
data between scripts. Typically, file-based input and output is necessary for
multi-lingual pipelines.
</div>

## Efficient Pipelines

<div class="notes">
There is no reason to run every step of a pipeline for changes made
"downstream". Like more comprehensive software for automating pipelines,
[rmarkdown][1] includes the notion of tracking dependencies and caching results.
Cached code chunks are not re-evaluated unless the content of the code changes.
</div>

Enable `cache` in the `setup` chunk to turn off evaluation of every code
chunk that has not been modified since last execution.

```
```{r setup}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```
```

## Cache Dependencies (preformatted)

With the `dependson` option, even an unmodified chunk will be re-evaluated if
any chunk included as a dependency runs.

```
```{r, dependson = 'base_plot', out.width = '80%'}
plt + geom_point()
```
```

## Cache Dependencies

This time, without the code fence, the plot will be updated anytime the
`load_data` or `base_plot` chunks runs.

```{... out.width = '80%'}
plt + geom_point()
```

## External Dependencies

By adding the option `cache.extra`, any queue can be given to force
re-evaluation of an unmodified chunk. In combination with the `md5sum` function
from the `tools` package, this permits external file dependencies.

```
```{r setup}
library(knitr)
library(tools)
opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```
```

```
```{r load_data, echo = FALSE, cache.extra = md5sum('worksheet-9.R')}
source('worksheet-9.R')
```
```

<div class="notes">
A change to the `rodents` variable, possibly resulting from filtering in a
different year in the `worksheet-9.R`, will now be reflected in the
`geom_point` plot with `dependson = base_plot`, but not the `geom_bar` plot.
</div>

## Interact with Shiny

Enough on "smart" documents, what about "interactive"?

## What is Shiny?

Shiny is a web application framework for R that allows you to create interactive
apps for exploratory data analysis and visualization, to facilitate remote
collaboration, share results, and [much
more](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).

```
---
output: ioslides_presentation
runtime: shiny
---
```

## Input and Output

The [shiny][2] package provides functions that generate two key types of
content in the output document: input and output "widgets". The user can change
the input and the output, e.g. a table or plot, dynamically responds.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.extra = 'style="object-fit:contain;"'}
include_graphics('https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/interactive-rmarkdown-lesson/course/lesson.Rmd_files/arrows3.png')
```

<div class="notes">
Writing an interactive document requires careful attention to how your input and
output objects relate to each other, i.e. knowing what actions will initiate
what sections of code to run at what time.
</div>

## Input Objects (preformatted)

Input objects collect information from the user and save it into a list variable
called `input`. The value for any given named entity in the list updates when
the user changes the input widget with the corresponding name.

```
```{r echo = FALSE}
selectInput('pick_species',
  label = 'Pick a Species',
  choices = unique(species[['id']]))
```
```

## Input Objects

This time, without the code fence, the drop-down option menu appears in the
document.

```{... echo = FALSE}
...
```

<div class="notes">
RStudio has a nice [gallery][3] of input objects and accompanying sample code.
</div>

## Output objects (preformatted)

Output objects are created by several functions in the [shiny][2] package that
produce a range of widgets.

```
```{r echo = FALSE}
renderPlot(
  animals %>%
    filter(species_id == input[['pick_species']]) %>%
    ggplot(aes(year)) + 
      geom_bar()
```
```

## Output objects

This time, without the code fence, the document contains whatever plot the
user chose to view.

```{... echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
...
```

## Render Functions

Key functions for creating output objects:

- `renderPrint()`
- `renderText()`
- `renderPlot()`
- `renderTable()`
- `renderDataTable()`

## Reactivity

<div class="notes">
The output objects in an interactive document have to be understood in terms of
reactivity: each one "knows" its content should react to certain changes in the
environment, including to the `input` list.
</div>

Create additional environment-aware objects with `reactive()` from the
[shiny][2] package. A useful type of reactive object for an efficient pipeline
is the result of data manipulations, which can be calculated once and used
multiple times.

```
```{r echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
plot_data <- reactive({
  filter(animals,
         species_id == input[['pick_species']])
})
```
```

```
```{r echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
renderPlot({
  plot_data() %>%
  ggplot(aes(year)) +
    geom_bar()
})
```
```

<div class="notes">
In the worked example, the step of filtering the `animals` data frame still only
occurs once. In a scenario where the subset of animals were used for multiple
computations or vizualitions, creating the reactive `plot_data()` object makes
a more efficient pipeline.
</div>

## Exercises

## Exercise 1

Create a table with two columns, starting with a header row with fields
"Character" and "Example". Fill in the table with rows for the special Markdown
characters \*, \*\*, \^, and \~, providing an example of each.

## Exercise 2

Display your presentation on GitHub. Your repository on GitHub includes a free
web hosting service known as GitHub Pages. Publish your worksheet there with the
following steps.

- Copy the resulting HTML file to `docs/index.html`.
- Stage, commit & push the `docs/index.html` file to GitHub.
- On GitHub, under Settings > GitHub Pages, set `docs/` as the source.
